canvas-resize:
- I learnt how to resize a canvas.
- Originally I had very little experience with javascript, so I had to learn how to query for the canvas object and use object properties to change the size.
- This, however resulted in a static width change, it would not update if you resized the window. This is not very useful.
- However I added an actionListener to resize the canvas whenever the window is resized.
